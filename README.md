# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview
Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform that has experienced significant growth in recent years. In order to improve efficiency in analyzing and reporting data to company stakeholders and potential donors, they have decided to move their data from Excel to a PostgreSQL database.

## Expected Outcomes 
* Extraction and transformation of data from the large Excel file into CSV files
* Creation of a PostgreSQL database and tables using an entity relationship diagram (ERD)
* Performance of SQL queries to generate desired reports.

For this project, we utilized the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to create data pipelines. This flexible process involves three phases: extraction, where data is read from multiple sources; transformation, where data is cleaned and structured into the desired format; and loading, where data is written into a database for storage.
